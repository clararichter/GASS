GASS - Git Assignment Submission System

The Git Assignment Submission System (GASS) is a tool that assists with managing programming assignments in CS courses. Version control is a critical tool for students looking for CS internships, therefore early introduction of version control into the undergraduate program is highly desirable. Unfortunately, version control does not play well with classic adacedemic assignment structure or learning management systems (LMS). GASS aims to bridge this gap and reduce the level of effort for functionality testing of student code.
