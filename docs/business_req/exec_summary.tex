The \longname~(\acronym) is a tool that assists with managing programming assignments in CS courses. 
Version control is a critical tool for students looking for CS internships, therefore early introduction of version control into the undergraduate program is highly desirable. 
Unfortunately, version control does not play well with classic adacedemic assignment structure or learning management systems (LMS). 
\acronym~aims to bridge this gap and reduce the level of effort for functionality testing of student code.

GitHub and GitLab both have offerrings targeting the education market. 
These offerings have had production interruptions and create a dependency on the timelines of the vendors. These issues can be a major problem for classes operating on the block. 
A 12 hour service outage or delay of a day or two setting up a class would be a catastrophic failure in the block environment. 
\acronym~in-houses the classroom git hosting to provide more local control over service interruptions.
